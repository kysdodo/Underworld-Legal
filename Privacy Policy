Proxy – Privacy Policy

Last Updated: April 12, 2025


---

1. Introduction

Welcome to Proxy (“the Bot,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your data. This Privacy Policy explains what information we process, why we process it, and how we handle it.


---

2. What Data We Process

1. Link & Command Data

We process the links or commands you provide to the Bot (e.g., adlinks or script requests) in real time.

These are not stored after processing.


2. Minimal Logging

We may temporarily log the command or link and a timestamp only for debugging or error handling.

These logs do not include your username, avatar, Discord ID, or other personal information.


3. No Personal Data Collection

We do not collect or store:

Discord usernames

User avatars

Status, bios

Email addresses, phone numbers, or any other personally identifiable information.




---

3. How We Use Your Data

To provide features like adlink bypassing, Roblox update fetching, and script delivery.

To identify bugs, improve the bot, and ensure everything runs smoothly.



---

4. Third-Party Services

1. External APIs

Proxy may use third-party APIs (e.g., for Roblox data).

These services may process IP addresses or other metadata outside our control.


2. Redirected Content

When bypassing adlinks or retrieving scripts, Proxy may link to external websites. Please check their privacy policies separately.



---

5. Data Retention

Real-time data (e.g., adlink URLs or scripting commands) is not stored after the request is completed.

Logs for troubleshooting are temporary and deleted or anonymized after resolution.



---

6. User Control

Remove the Bot from your server at any time to stop all data processing.

If you believe any data is being stored, you can contact us, though no personal data should exist.



---

7. Data Security

We use secure hosting and industry-standard protections for all temporary processing.

No data transmission method is 100% secure, but we take reasonable steps to protect your privacy.



---

8. Children’s Privacy

Proxy follows Discord’s age requirement (typically 13+). We do not knowingly process data from users under 13.


---

9. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy as needed. You’ll always find the latest version via the bot’s documentation or repository. Continued use implies acceptance of updates.
