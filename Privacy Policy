Last Updated: April 22, 2025


1. Introduction
Welcome to Proxy ("the Bot," "we," "us," or "our"). This Privacy Policy explains what information we process, why we process it, and how we handle it.


2. What Data We Process
We process the links or commands you provide to the Bot (e.g., adlinks or script requests) in real time. These are not stored after processing.


3. No Personal Data Collection
We do not collect or store:

Discord usernames, User avatars, Status, bios, Email addresses, Phone numbers, Any other personally identifiable information


4. Redirected Content
When bypassing adlinks or retrieving scripts, Proxy may link to external websites. Please review their privacy policies separately, as we are not responsible for third-party practices.


5. Data Retention
Real-time data (e.g., adlink URLs or script commands) is not stored after the request is completed.


6. Children's Privacy
Proxy adheres to Discord’s age requirement of 13+. We do not knowingly process data from users under 13.


7. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy as needed. You’ll always find the latest version in the bot’s documentation or repository. Continued use of Proxy implies acceptance of updates.
