PROXY – PRIVACY POLICY
Last Updated: August 27, 2025

1. Introduction
Welcome to Proxy (“the Bot,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). This Privacy Policy explains what information Proxy processes, why we process it, and how we protect it.

2. What Data We Process
When you use Proxy, Discord sends us the content of your command (e.g., a URL for bypassing, a script request, or an update query). We process this information in real time to perform the requested function and return results to you in Discord.

3. Logging via Discord Webhook
For moderation, debugging, and abuse-prevention, Proxy sends certain usage logs to a private Discord channel via a secure webhook that we control. Logged information may include:
• The URL you submitted
• The result of the bypass or script request
• Basic context such as timestamp and the server/channel where the command was used
Logs are stored only within Discord. We do not export these logs to external databases.

4. No Intentional Collection of Personal Data
We do not intentionally collect or store Discord usernames, avatars, emails, phone numbers, payment data, or other personally identifiable information. However, URLs or content you submit may contain personal data. Do not share sensitive or personal information through Proxy.

5. Data Retention
Logs sent via webhook remain in the designated private Discord channel until deleted manually or subject to Discord’s retention limits. We do not maintain separate databases of user activity. Real-time processing data is discarded once handled, except for the logged copy described above.

6. Security
Processing occurs via the official Discord API over encrypted connections. Access to webhook logs is restricted to authorized maintainers of Proxy. Because we avoid external databases, the risk of external data leakage is reduced; however, no system is perfectly secure.

7. Redirected Content
Proxy may return or redirect you to third-party websites (for example, after bypassing an ad-link). We do not control those sites and are not responsible for their content or privacy practices. Review third-party privacy policies separately.

8. Children’s Privacy
You must be at least 13 years old, or the minimum digital age of consent in your country (16 in some jurisdictions). We do not knowingly process data from users under this age.

9. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect new features, security improvements, or legal requirements. The latest version will be available in Proxy’s documentation or repository. Continued use of Proxy means you accept the updated policy.

10. Governing Law
This Privacy Policy is governed by the laws of India, including the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, without regard to conflict-of-law principles.
