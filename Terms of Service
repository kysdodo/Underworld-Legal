PROXY – TERMS OF SERVICE
Last Updated: August 27, 2025

1. Introduction
Welcome to Proxy (“the Bot,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). By adding Proxy to your Discord server or using it, you agree to these Terms of Service (“Terms”). Please read them carefully.

2. What the Bot Does
A. Ad-Link Scanning Service
Proxy processes URLs from supported advertising-based link services (e.g., Linkvertise, AdFocus) using external APIs to bypass ad pages and retrieve the direct destination link.

B. Roblox Studio Scripting
Proxy provides commands that fetch Roblox scripting code via external APIs for educational and project-building purposes. Proxy is not intended for exploit-related scripts.

C. Roblox Update Notifications
Proxy includes an “Update Notifier” that checks official Roblox sources for new versions and may send alerts to a Discord channel.

3. Data and Privacy
Proxy processes commands and URLs in real time to provide its features. For moderation, debugging, and abuse-prevention, Proxy logs submitted URLs, their results, and basic context (such as timestamp and server/channel) via a private Discord webhook controlled by us. Logs are stored only within Discord and are not exported to external databases. For details, see our Privacy Policy.

4. User Responsibilities
By using Proxy, you agree to:
1) Follow Discord’s Community Guidelines, Roblox’s Terms of Use, and all applicable laws.
2) Not use Proxy for illegal or harmful purposes (including harassment, spam, raids, or distributing malware).
3) Take responsibility for how you use bypassed links or scripts and comply with applicable third-party terms.
4) Avoid sharing sensitive or personally identifiable information through Proxy.
5) Be at least 13 years old, or the minimum digital age of consent in your jurisdiction.

Violations may result in suspension or termination of access to Proxy and, where appropriate, reports to Discord Trust & Safety.

5. Third-Party Content and APIs
Proxy uses external APIs and may direct you to third-party websites. We do not control and are not responsible for the accuracy, reliability, legality, or safety of third-party content or services. Review third-party terms and privacy policies separately.

6. Disclaimers
Independent Service: Proxy is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or partnered with Roblox, Discord, or any third-party API providers.
No Guarantee: Proxy is provided “as is” and “as available,” without warranties of any kind, including uptime, accuracy, or fitness for a particular purpose.
Risk Acceptance: Ad-link bypassing and external data may lead to unsafe or unexpected destinations. You assume all risks when using Proxy.

7. Limitation of Liability
To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or exemplary damages arising from or related to your use of Proxy, including issues involving ad-link bypassing, Roblox scripts, or third-party content. Your sole remedy is to stop using Proxy.

8. Intellectual Property
Proxy IP: All code, design, and branding related to Proxy are our intellectual property. Unauthorized copying, modification, or distribution is prohibited.
User Content: Content you generate through Proxy remains yours. You grant us a limited license to process and display it as needed for Bot operation.
Third-Party Rights: Roblox and other referenced names are trademarks of their respective owners. No endorsement or affiliation is implied.

9. Payments
Proxy is currently provided free of charge. We do not request or process payments. If premium features are introduced, these Terms will be updated.

10. Service Changes
We may add, remove, or modify features of Proxy at any time without prior notice.

11. Termination
User Termination: You may remove Proxy from your server at any time.
Service Termination: We may suspend, restrict, or discontinue Proxy at our discretion, including for violations of these Terms.

12. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution
These Terms are governed by the laws of India, without regard to conflict-of-law principles. You agree to first attempt to resolve disputes informally by contacting us. Subject to applicable law, courts located in India shall have exclusive jurisdiction.
